Matrix multiplication is linear transformation for vectors, and characteristic vectors are the vectors that do not change direction under these linear transformations.

        "$A\\mathbf{x}=\\lambda\\mathbf{x}$ is equivalent to the linear system $(A-\\lambda\\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$, and we look for non-zero solutions to this system. Generally, we need to find first all eigenvalues $\\lambda_1,...,\\lambda_k$ (in Section 4.2), then for each eigenvalue, we solve the homogeneous system and find _all_ corresponding eigenvectors. This is effectively finding the null space of $A-\\lambda\\mathbf{I}$.\n",
