# tmath308summer19
This repository contains the labs for TMATH 308 in Summer 2019; you can find all jupyter notebooks here. 

If you have local version of these softwares, feel free to use your own machine to work on the labs. 

# The following is optional. The purpose is to make it easier for version control. You do not need to use Binder to run the labs, but you do need to use Jupyter notebook.

click below for Jupyter Notebook via Binder! 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yajuna/tmath308summer19/master?urlpath=/tree/)

It might take a few minutes for the jupyter notebook to open up. You can read the Build log while waiting. The jupyter notebook prompted by binder will deactivate after 10 minutes if you do not do anything with it, and you woud lose your work. I suggest you fork the repo if you have a github account; or download if you do not.
